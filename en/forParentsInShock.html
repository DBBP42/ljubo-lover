            <h3>Stay Calm</h3>
            <p>Your child is watching you to see if they are safe. If you panic, they may feel they have to protect <em>you</em> instead of being protected.</p>

          <div class="path-card">
            <h3>Believe Them</h3>
            <p>The most important thing you can say is: "I believe you. It is not your fault. I am glad you told me."</p>

          <div class="path-card">
            <h3>Don't Interrogate</h3>

            <h3>Safety First</h3>

        <ul class="principles-list">
          <li><strong>Blaming the child:</strong> Never ask "Why didn't you tell me sooner?" or "Why did you go there?"</li>
          <li><strong>Making it about you:</strong> Avoid saying "How could you do this to our family?" or "I can't handle this."</li>
          <li><strong>Seeking immediate revenge:</strong> Taking matters into your own hands can jeopardize legal proceedings and put you and your child at further risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Forcing them to talk:</strong> If they shut down, let them. Just stay present and available.</li>
