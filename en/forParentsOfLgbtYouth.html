        <h1>For Parents of LGBT+ Youth</h1>
        <p class="lead">When an LGBT+ child experiences abuse, they often face additional fears about being judged for their identity. Your acceptance is their strongest shield.</p>

          <div class="path-card">
            <h3>Fear of "Outing"</h3>
            <p>The child may fear that reporting the abuse will force them to come out to you, the police, or the community before they are ready.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="path-card">
            <h3>Community Pressure</h3>
            <p>If the perpetrator is also LGBT+, the child may feel they are "betraying the community" by speaking out.</p>

          <div class="path-card">
            <h3>Internalized Stigma</h3>
            <p>They may believe they "deserved" it because of their identity or that no one will believe an LGBT+ victim.</p>

          <div class="path-card">
            <h3>Lack of Role Models</h3>

        <h2>Affirming their identity</h2>
        <p>Your child needs to know that their identity is not the cause of the abuse and that you love them unconditionally.</p>
        <ul class="principles-list">
          <li><strong>Use their names/pronouns:</strong> Respecting their identity shows you are on their side.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't blame the "lifestyle":</strong> Avoid suggesting that the abuse happened because they are LGBT+ or because of the places they go.</li>
          <li><strong>Find inclusive help:</strong> Ensure any therapist or lawyer you hire is explicitly LGBT+ friendly.</li>
          <li><strong>Listen without judgment:</strong> Let them explain their world to you without trying to "fix" their identity.</li>

        <h2>You are their safe harbor</h2>
        <p>By accepting your child fully, you give them the foundation they need to process their trauma and build a future where they can be their authentic selves.</p>
