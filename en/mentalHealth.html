        <p>Recovery is not a straight line. It's a series of small, intentional choices to care for yourself.</p>
        <ul class="principles-list">
          <li><strong>Grounding:</strong> Techniques like the "5-4-3-2-1" method to bring your focus back to the present moment.</li>
          <li><strong>Boundaries:</strong> Learning to say "no" to people or situations that drain your energy or feel unsafe.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional Help:</strong> Finding a trauma-informed therapist who specializes in EMDR, CBT, or somatic experiencing.</li>
          <li><strong>Self-Compassion:</strong> Treating yourself with the same kindness you would offer a dear friend in the same situation.</li>
