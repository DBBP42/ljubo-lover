            <h3>Forensic Interview</h3>
            <p>A specially trained professional will talk to your child in a child-friendly environment. This is recorded to minimize the number of times they have to tell their story.</p>

            <h3>Medical Exam</h3>
            <p>A "SANE" (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) or pediatrician will check for injuries and collect evidence. This should always be done with the child's comfort in mind.</p>

          <li><strong>Ask for updates:</strong> You have the right to know the status of the investigation.</li>
          <li><strong>Request child-friendly spaces:</strong> If a meeting is scheduled in a cold, intimidating office, ask for a better alternative.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor their behavior:</strong> Watch for changes in sleep, eating, or school performance, and report these to their therapist.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep a paper trail:</strong> Document all interactions with police, social services, and medical professionals.</li>
