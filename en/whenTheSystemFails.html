        <h1>When the System Fails</h1>
        <p class="lead">Sometimes, despite your courage and the evidence, the legal system does not deliver the outcome you deserve. This is a failure of the system, not a failure of you.</p>

            <h3>Lack of Evidence</h3>
            <p>The legal standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt" is extremely high, especially in cases without physical evidence or witnesses.</p>

          <div class="path-card">
            <h3>Statute of Limitations</h3>
            <p>In many places, there is a time limit on when a crime can be reported, which ignores the reality of how long it takes to process trauma.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="path-card">
            <h3>Institutional Bias</h3>
            <p>Prejudice against victims based on their identity, lifestyle, or past can lead to cases being dismissed or poorly investigated.</p>

          <div class="path-card">
            <h3>Legal Technicalities</h3>
            <p>Procedural errors or changes in the law can sometimes lead to a case being dropped regardless of the facts.</p>

        <h2>Dealing with the "Not Guilty" verdict</h2>
        <p>A "not guilty" verdict does not mean "it didn't happen." It only means the legal system couldn't meet its specific criteria for conviction.</p>
        <ul class="principles-list">
          <li><strong>Validate your truth:</strong> Your experience is real, regardless of what a piece of paper says.</li>
          <li><strong>Allow yourself to grieve:</strong> It is normal to feel anger, betrayal, and deep sadness when the system fails you.</li>
          <li><strong>Seek community:</strong> Connect with others who have had similar experiences. You are not alone in this frustration.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus on your healing:</strong> The legal process is over. Now, all your energy can go back to your own recovery.</li>

        <p>True justice is your ability to live a full, safe, and happy life. The system may have failed to punish the perpetrator, but it cannot stop you from healing.</p>
